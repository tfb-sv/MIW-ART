name: Molecular Interpretation Workflow through Attentive Recursive Tree Model
description: To identify and interpret the significant drug molecule fragments for
  the corresponding molecular property tasks (e.g., physiology, biophysics, and physical
  chemistry), we propose a sequence of processes named Molecular Interpretation Workflow
  through Attentive Recursive Tree Model (MIW-ART) by utilizing the Attention Recursive
  Tree (AR-Tree) model.
